# Iris Flower Classification

This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — using the popular **Random Forest** algorithm.

## Objective

To build a classification model using the **scikit-learn** library that can predict the species of an iris flower based on its petal and sepal measurements.

## Dataset

The project uses the famous **Iris dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is also directly available in `sklearn.datasets`.

Features include:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Target classes:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## ML Model Used

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Library**: `scikit-learn`
- **Train/Test Split**: 80/20
- **Metric**: Accuracy and classification report
